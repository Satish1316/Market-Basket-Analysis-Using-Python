# Market Basket Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project applies **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** using Python to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. By analyzing transactional data, we identify items frequently bought together, offering valuable insights for optimizing **product recommendations**, **cross-selling strategies**, and **marketing campaigns**. The project utilizes the **Apriori algorithm** to generate frequent itemsets and association rules, followed by a detailed visual analysis of the results.



## Data Description
The dataset contains customer transactions, where each transaction includes the items purchased and their quantities. This data is essential for identifying frequent itemsets and generating rules that help to recommend products that are commonly purchased together.

| Column Name      | Description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `Transaction ID` | Unique identifier for each transaction|
| `Item`           | Product bought in the transaction     |
| `Quantity`       | Quantity of the product purchased     |

Sample data:
| Transaction ID | Item          | Quantity |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| 1              | Bread         | 1        |
| 1              | Butter        | 2        |
| 2              | Milk          | 1        |
| 2              | Eggs          | 1        |
| 3              | Coffee        | 1        |
| 3              | Sugar         | 1        |

## Analysis Overview
This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - The raw transactional data was cleaned and transformed into a structured format using **Pandas**.
    - Missing values were handled, and each transaction was broken down into individual items.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - We analyzed item frequency and visualized the distribution of transactions using bar charts and histograms.
    - Top 10 most frequent items were identified to understand customer preferences.

3. **Apriori Algorithm**:
    - The Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequent itemsets.
    - Association rules were generated based on **support**, **confidence**, and **lift** to quantify the strength of relationships between items.

4. **Visualization**:
    - Key findings were illustrated using bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to make the data insights more intuitive and actionable.

## Key Concepts
- **Support**: Percentage of transactions that contain a particular itemset.
- **Confidence**: Likelihood that a product will be purchased if another product is already in the basket.
- **Lift**: How much more likely two items are bought together than expected if they were independent.

## Frequent Itemsets
Using the Apriori algorithm, we identified frequent itemsets based on a minimum support threshold of 0.05 (5%).

| Itemset              | Support |
|----------------------|---------|
| Bread, Butter        | 0.08    |
| Milk, Eggs           | 0.12    |
| Coffee, Sugar        | 0.10    |
| Tea, Biscuits        | 0.07    |
| Bread, Milk          | 0.09    |

## Association Rules
Association rules were generated with a minimum confidence level of 0.7 and lift greater than 1, indicating meaningful relationships between products.

| Rule                    | Confidence | Lift  |
|-------------------------|------------|-------|
| {Bread} -> {Butter}      | 0.70       | 1.30  |
| {Milk} -> {Eggs}         | 0.85       | 1.45  |
| {Coffee} -> {Sugar}      | 0.60       | 1.20  |
| {Tea} -> {Biscuits}      | 0.75       | 1.35  |
| {Bread, Butter} -> {Milk}| 0.65       | 1.28  |

## Outputs

### Frequent Itemset Output:
The most frequently bought itemsets are illustrated below, showing products that appear together in multiple transactions. This output was generated by applying the **Apriori** algorithm:

```
Frequent Itemsets:
1. {'Bread', 'Butter'} - Support: 0.08
2. {'Milk', 'Eggs'} - Support: 0.12
3. {'Coffee', 'Sugar'} - Support: 0.10
```

### Association Rules Output:
The association rules generated highlight products with strong relationships. The table below shows the **Confidence** and **Lift** values of each rule.

```
Association Rules:
1. {'Bread'} -> {'Butter'} - Confidence: 0.70, Lift: 1.30
2. {'Milk'} -> {'Eggs'} - Confidence: 0.85, Lift: 1.45
3. {'Tea'} -> {'Biscuits'} - Confidence: 0.75, Lift: 1.35
```

### Visualization Outputs:
#### 1. Top 10 Most Frequent Items:
A **bar plot** visualizing the 10 most frequently purchased items, providing a clear picture of customer preferences.

#### 2. Heatmap:
A **heatmap** was used to visualize the correlation between different items based on their **lift** values, helping to identify strong product associations.

#### 3. Confidence vs. Lift Scatter Plot:
A **scatter plot** was created to analyze the association rules by plotting **confidence** against **lift** values, giving insights into the strength of the rules.

## Results
- **{Milk -> Eggs}** shows the strongest association, with a **confidence** of 85% and a **lift** of 1.45, suggesting that customers who purchase milk are highly likely to buy eggs.
- **{Bread -> Butter}** reveals a common pattern with a **confidence** of 70%, indicating a strong relationship between these staple products.
- The **heatmap** of item associations clearly indicates which product pairs exhibit the highest correlation, providing actionable insights for product placement and promotions.

## Conclusion
The Market Basket Analysis performed on this transactional dataset provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior. The frequent itemsets and association rules identified through the Apriori algorithm can help retailers to:
- Improve product placement strategies by grouping frequently bought items together.
- Develop personalized recommendation systems based on customer purchasing patterns.
- Create effective cross-selling and promotional campaigns.

By understanding customer buying trends, retailers can optimize their inventory management, boost sales, and enhance the overall shopping experience.
